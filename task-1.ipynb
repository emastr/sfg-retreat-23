    "\n",
    "Your task is to decrypt the numerical tools needed to run forensics on the smudged image. Give the answers to questions 1-12 in the form of a python list containing twelve tuples of size 2 each, containing your upper and lower bound (in the correct unit). \n",

    "### Example:\n",

    "Emanuel is not so sure about any of the questions, so he puts an interval of $(10^{-10}, 10^{10})$ as his answer. For all the questions. He would then run the following code snippet:\n",
